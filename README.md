## Project Overview

This repository documents my journey through the "Generative AI for Developers" course by freeCodeCamp.org. The course provides an in-depth exploration of generative AI, covering topics such as large language models, data preprocessing, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and hands-on projects utilizing tools like Hugging Face, OpenAI, and LangChain.
